mdlit("In conclusion, the collection of plots presented in this project provide a detailed analysis of the restaurant industry in Bangalore. The bar graph of restaurants name (x) and number of outlets (y) showed that 'Cafe Coffee Day' has the highest number of outlets in Bangalore with 73 outlets, followed by 'Five Star Chicken' with 61 outlets. The scatter plot of rating of restaurant and cost of restaurant demonstrated a positive correlation between the cost of dining at a restaurant and the rating of that restaurant. The location wise box plot of approximate cost for two people in that location revealed that Indranagar, Lavelle Road, Malleshwaram, brigade road, church street, Airport Road has the highest cost for two people. The scatter plot of approximate cost for two people, location and online_order demonstrated that ordering online is cheaper in almost all locations. The box plot of online ordering and table booking versus ratings supported the hypothesis that restaurants that offer both online ordering and table booking have higher ratings on average. The bar plot of most common restaurants type in each area showed that the most common type of restaurant in each area is Quick Bites while Food Court, Meat Shop and Beverage Shop are the least common type of restaurants in Bangalore.")
mdlit("The tree map plot of top 15 most common cuisines in bangalore, using squarify, showed that the most common cuisine in Bangalore is North Indian, followed by Chinese cuisine.
